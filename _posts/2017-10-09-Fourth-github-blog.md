  <tr>
    <td>I learnt really well as the strategy was that one person is the driver who basically types the coding into the fuze box, there was a navigator as well that tells the driver what to type in
In and what not to type, and then there is a over see who looks that the coding is right and isn't wrong so the coding works, this works when you switch over so that one person doesn’t get bored doing the same thing.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Try to type faster as you can do more and cover more stuff. Make the navigator say what to write and this will help as it is faster than looking at the book over and over again. Also make sure I don’t fiddle with things either as it is really distracting to me and the other in the class. </td>

    <td>Save the work on the usb first time round so you won’t have to do it again. Also make sure that my partner is doing the right thing and he isn’t doing the wrong things or pressing the wrong buttons. Make sure the wires connected to fuze box and is connected properly so it doesn’t get out half way through and loses all the work </td>
