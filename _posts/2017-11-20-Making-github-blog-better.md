    <td>Add a background to make the github blog look appealing so people want to look at my blog and also to change the colour of the writing and make it to not blend in with the background. I learnt really well as the strategy was that one person is the driver who basically types the coding into the fuze box, there was a navigator as well that tells the driver what to type in 
In and what not to type, and then there is a over see who looks that the coding is right and isn't wrong so the coding works, this works when you switch over so that one person doesn’t get bored doing the same thing. </td>

    <td>There was only a few things that limited my learning that were ; that when you take the usb without pressing eject it would make the fuze box start all over again and then all the work is lost so you have to waste time doing work all over again. Then there is that you have type quickly and accurately. Then the mouse is really sensitive so you have to be careful when you 
Move the mouse </td>

    <td>I will be more careful when using the mouse as it is really sensitive as it will some time make you write the work in some place where you don’t want your work to be. Be suree to press eject before taking out usb so you don’t lose all your work. </td>
