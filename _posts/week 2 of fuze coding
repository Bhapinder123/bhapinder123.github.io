    <td>I learnt how to program the fuze box to count down from the total amount of fruits when some  are eaten. Use shift instead of caps lock as it was quicker as there were a lot of capitals. 
The navigator should be clear when speaking as well as it helps to understand it better. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Try to type faster as you can do more and cover more stuff. Make the navigator say what to write and this will help as it is faster than cings either as it is really distracting to me and the other in the class. </td>

    <td>Save the work on the usb first time round so you won't have to do it again. Also make sure that my partner is doing the right thing and he isn’t doing the wrong things or pressing the wrong buttons. Make sure the wires connected to fuze box and is connected properly so it doesn’t get out halfway through and loses all the work. </td>
