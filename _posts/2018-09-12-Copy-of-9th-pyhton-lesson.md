    <td>Type faster and read the instructions properly. Also when i get something wrong i should not get help straight away so i can learn myself and try not to talk as much so i can get more work done and dont leave so many spaces so the code work and that waste time. Also try to do some more in class so i can complete quicker and that means that i can quicker </td>
